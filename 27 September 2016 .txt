Name : Centroid-Based Document Classification: Analysis and Experimental Results

Author:

Eui-Hong (Sam), George Karypis


Abstract:

In this paper they presented a simple linear-time centroid-based document classification algorithm.It had not been widely practised and 
exploration though its simplicity and robust perpormance.Their experiments showed centroidbased classifier consistently and strongly omitted other
algorithms such as Naive Bayesian , K-nearest-neighbors and C4.5 on large range of datasets.Their analysis showed the similarity and allowed to classify
a new document depending on the behavior of the documents belonging to different classes.

Name: Cross-Lingual Short-Text Document Classification for Facebook Comments

Author: Mosab Faqeeh et al.

This paper investigated Document Classifcation on cross lingual heuristics. It delved into document classification on
English and Arabic languages simultaneously using data from comments, and posts from Facebook. They intended to investigatethe 
differences in performance between the SVM, NB, KNN, and DT. KNN was added because of its high sensivity. It was more
accurate than the other three but less efficient.
